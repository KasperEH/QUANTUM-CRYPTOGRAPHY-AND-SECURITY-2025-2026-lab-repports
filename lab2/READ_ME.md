To run this code, it is expected that you can run the code in this [this](https://github.com/marcoavesani/QKD_LDPC_python/tree/master) github libary. This code is based on the code from the mentioned github library.

I have left the results of the simulations since they take quite a while to run. 

To generate table 1 or 2, run `python test_error_correction.py`, it can be addapted for both cases. It does not print exactly what is in the report, but it has to be formatted.

To generate the adaptive codes, base rates, and LLR, run `python test_advanced_simulation.py`. You can determine what runs in the main file.

To test CASCADE, WINNOW, and LDPC against each other,r run `python test_classic_vs_ldpc. 

Generative AI has been made to make this code.
