These are the files for analysing the data from the third lad on QKD. 

Before you can run it, you need to add the data from the lab to the ```lab3``` folder, not in a data folder.

To run, first compile the Cthon code with `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`, then you can run the analysis.py script with `python analysis.py`.
