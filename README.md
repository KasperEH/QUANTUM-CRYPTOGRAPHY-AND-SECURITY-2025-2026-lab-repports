This repository is the code for the analysis of the 3 lab sessions in the course QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY AND SECURITY 2025-2026 at University of Padova. This repository has been made by Kasper Emil Hebsgaard. 

In each lab folder, a README.md file will be included to describe how to run the code.

Artificial Intelligence (mainly Google Gemini) has been used to write the code.
